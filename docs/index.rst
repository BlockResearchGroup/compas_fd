Constrained Form Finding with Iterative Force Density
********************************************************************************

.. rst-class:: lead

This package provides equilibrium solvers and constraints
for constrained form finding using the "force density" method.
The solvers can be used through the :mod:`compas_fd` package directly,
or through COMPAS FormFinder, which is a form finding tool with a GUI
combining various different form finding approaches.
